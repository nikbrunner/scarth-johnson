## Review of Chapter 3 - 2025.05.23 - Friday

Hi there, so I read Chapter 3 and I think it is a good read, but I have some
points to make.

- There are very sudden situation changes between Lin's Shop and Kenji's
  Boutique. I think this would be a good time to explore the city and world of
  N'Kyoto and how Scarth experiences this world.
- I find it a bit boring and on the Nose that Lin and Dex are always "so well
  informed". To be honest this is rather something that would fit to Dex, rather
  then to Lin.
- Generally I think Chapter 3 is a good read, but I am thinking about that it
  either should be generally longer or we make an extra chapter just for the pre
  event stuff and take more time for Lin, Kenji and Dex
- I think Diana Weiss and Haruki Tanaka are interresting and fine for now.

Generally I would like Chapters to be longer. I think around 6000 - 7000 words.
Currently it has around 3200 words. I like slow pacing and dialogue and
obersavations.

I have not read Chapter 4 yet.
