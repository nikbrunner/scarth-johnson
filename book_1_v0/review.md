# Review of v0

I have read the first two chapters of the book, and I think it's generally quite
good. I haven't read Chapter 3 yet, but I plan to read the non-reviewed version.
But I wanted to share my review with you now. I would like to hear your thoughts
on this. Perhaps some of these concerns are addressed in Chapter 3?

This is what I liked about it:

- The story is very well written in style.
- The characters are diverse.
- The world feels real.
- The story itself is interesting and can be enjoyed by anyone. It also serves
  as a foundation for more books that can be built upon.
- I like the main character, Scarth, very much.

However, I also have some concerns:

- There are too many "meetings" between factions without enough "action."
    - While the meetings are important, chapters 1 and 2 consist mainly of these
      meetings, which become boring to read at times.
    - The netrunning actions are cool, but the story should also include
      infiltration and similar elements.
- There is too little "spice."
    - Combined with the previous point, the story sometimes feels a bit dry.
    - This should be an adult book, not a children's book.
    - I envision Dex and Raven as potential love interests for Scarth, with
      scenes that establish this, including flirting, meaningful glances, and
      even kissing and sex scenes.
    - For example, when Scarth leaves her room and passes Dex, she could catch
      him looking at her, not hiding his interest. They have a history, and I
      can imagine them trying to resist past feelings and habits but potentially
      relapsing.
    - Raven, on the other hand, is a new character in Scarth's life with
      ideological goals and could also be a love interest. Scarth is attracted
      to the ideological Raven and the prospect of a "new life."
- The discussed character traits of Scarth do not play a significant role in the
  story.
    - For instance, she is an introvert but enjoys the passive attention she
      receives for being very attractive. The story should include more scenes
      that showcase her traits, which could create interesting dynamics when she
      interacts with Dex, Raven, and other characters. This should be subtle
      rather than overt.
    - When we "hear" or read Scarth's thoughts, they should feel more authentic.
      For example, instead of saying, "I caught him looking at the curves of my
      hips," it should be more direct, like, "He was looking at my ass." This
      sounds more realistic.
    - Regarding her clothing style, I would like her to be known for always
      wearing tight black or colored leggings in private and a tight nylon
      military armored bodysuit when on the job. In her mind, her eyes, legs and
      ass are her best bodily features, and the attention she receives for them
      confirms this.
    - Her hair, an inverted bob with longer strands in the front than in the
      back, should be an ashen pink.
    - Also she is know for wearing minimal, but very long dark eyeliners
- Importantly, the story currently feels a bit too predictable. I would like it
  to be more suspenseful and surprising, but in a good way, not just for the
  sake of being surprising. Some mysteries should be maintained. "Severance" or
  "Silo" are good examples of this.
- The story should also include more aspects of private life, such as normal
  interactions with family or strangers in the world of Night City. This could
  provide opportunities to showcase Scarth's traits that I mentioned earlier.

I see "Game of Thrones" as a good example of a story that balances deep and
engaging dialogue, action, interpersonal relationships, and a lot of love and
eroticism without being cringe-worthy.

What you need to understand is that the whole story is just for me. We don't
need to worry about how others will react to it.

I secretly wish to be a woman instead of a man, but I have accepted that I am a
man. However, I would like to see the world through Scarth's eyes, and I believe
that's what this book is about. I also want to experience love and sex through
her perspective. In this way, I hope to heal my own emotional wounds. So if
you're concerned about including some erotic elements in this story, you don't
need to worry. It's essentially therapy for me.

What do you think?
