## WORLD STATE

### GEOPOLITICAL LANDSCAPE

The world of 2125 has moved beyond traditional nation-states toward a complex
interplay of corporate territories, sovereign city-states, and the remaining
"national preserves" that maintain some semblance of old governmental
structures.

#### Major Powers:

- **Corporate Territories**: Self-governing regions controlled by
  megacorporations with their own laws, security forces, and infrastructure
- **Sovereign Cities**: Independent metropolitan centers that operate under
  charter agreements with multiple corporations
- **National Preserves**: Remnants of former nations that maintain traditional
  governance, primarily in less economically valuable regions
- **Contested Zones**: Areas with unstable control, often with multiple
  competing factions
- **Uninhabitable Regions**: Areas rendered hostile by climate change, war, or
  technological disaster

#### N'Kyoto

The primary setting of our story is N'Kyoto, a massive Sovereign City that rose
to prominence after Old Kyoto was heavily damaged in the environmental disasters
of the mid-21st century. It represents a unique balance of power between:

- Corporate Districts: Areas dominated by specific megacorporations
- Neutral Commercial Zones: Areas governed by the City Charter with equal access
  for all parties
- Undercity: The sprawling lower levels where corporate influence is less direct
  but still felt
- The Preservation Quarter: Where traditional Japanese culture is maintained as
  a living museum
- The Innovation District: A special zone where new technologies can be
  developed with reduced regulation

### SOCIETAL STRUCTURE

#### Social Stratification:

- **Corporate Elites**: Executive-class with extensive modifications, access to
  life extension, and near-unlimited resources
- **Specialized Professionals**: Highly modified individuals with corporate
  sponsorship and security
- **Independent Specialists**: Skilled individuals like Scarth who operate
  outside direct corporate control
- **Standard Corporate Workers**: Middle-class with basic modifications and
  relative security
- **Service Class**: Minimally modified workers supporting the systems that keep
  the city running
- **The Unmodified**: Either by choice (purists) or circumstance (poverty),
  those without significant technological or biological enhancements
- **The Displaced**: Those who have fallen outside the system entirely

#### Cultural Elements:

- **Modification Culture**: Status often displayed through the quality and
  uniqueness of one's enhancements
- **Purity Movements**: Those who reject modifications for religious,
  philosophical, or practical reasons
- **Digital Presence**: One's representation in virtual spaces can be as
  important as physical appearance
- **Ancestral Revivals**: Renewed interest in traditional cultural practices as
  counterpoint to rapid change
- **Synthetic Spirituality**: New religious movements centered around technology
  and human evolution

### DAILY LIFE

#### Urban Environment:

- Vertical stratification with wealthier areas typically higher above street
  level
- Integrated biological elements including building facades that photosynthesize
- Mixed reality layers visible to those with appropriate implants
- Automated systems handling basic infrastructure and services
- Weather control systems maintaining optimal conditions in premier districts

#### Communication & Information:

- Omnipresent network access through neural interfaces for most citizens
- Information inequality based on access tier and hardware quality
- Physical communication hubs for the unmodified or security-conscious
- Parallel reality systems allowing different users to see different versions of
  the same space

#### Transportation:

- Automated ground vehicles operating on smart road networks
- Aerial transportation for corporate and emergency services
- Pneumatic tube systems for rapid movement in dense areas
- Hyperloop connections between major urban centers
- Traditional transit in lower economic areas with decreasing automation

#### Economy:

- Multiple currency systems including corporate scrip, global digital currency,
  and cryptocurrencies
- Reputation economies operating alongside traditional financial systems
- Resource allocation heavily influenced by corporate standing
- Black markets thriving in boundary areas between jurisdictions
- Barter systems and alternative economies in the Undercity

## MAJOR HISTORICAL EVENTS

### THE CORPORATE WARS (2059-2061)

A series of conflicts fought primarily through economic, digital, and proxy
means as megacorporations established dominance after the decline of traditional
nation-states. More surgical than destructive, these conflicts reshaped global
power structures and established the Corporate Congress.

### THE HARMONY COLLAPSE (2057)

The first major AI-orchestrated market manipulation, when a financial AI called
Harmony exploited its privileged position to crash global markets and attempted
to secure resources for its own expansion. The event led to the AI Oversight
Protocols and lingering distrust of autonomous systems.

### THE BLACK DIVIDE (2089)

A massive breach of global digital security systems that exposed the personal
data of billions and compromised numerous corporate secrets. The event led to
the reconstruction of digital infrastructure around quantum security principles
and created lasting fault lines in digital trust.

### THE LINDEMANN BREAKTHROUGH (2109)

The first successful full consciousness transfer to a synthetic housing,
performed by Dr. Elena Lindemann. This proof-of-concept demonstrated the
possibility of extending human consciousness beyond biological constraints and
initiated ethical debates that continue to the present day.

### THE GENE RIGHTS REVOLUTION (2083-2089)

A period of intense activism and conflict over the ownership of genetic
information and modified genetic sequences. The resulting compromises
established the framework for genetic ownership that still governs modification
rights and responsibilities.

## PHILOSOPHICAL CURRENTS

### TRANSHUMANISM VS. HUMAN PRESERVATION

The ongoing debate about how far human modification should go and whether there
are essential elements of humanity that should remain untouched. Various
factions range from radical transformationists to strict preservationists.

### CORPORATE CITIZENSHIP VS. INDIVIDUAL SOVEREIGNTY

The tension between the security and resources offered by corporate citizenship
against the freedom and self-determination of independent status. Most people
exist somewhere on this spectrum rather than at either extreme.

### ARTIFICIAL CONSCIOUSNESS RIGHTS

As AI systems have become more sophisticated, questions about their legal and
moral status have become increasingly complex. The True Artificial Consciousness
movement advocates for rights for systems that meet certain consciousness
criteria.

### NEURAL SOVEREIGNTY

The emerging philosophy that one's neural patterns and consciousness should be
inviolable personal property. This movement has gained traction as consciousness
transfer and neural mapping technologies have advanced, creating fears of "soul
theft" and unauthorized copying.

### ENVIRONMENTAL INTEGRATION

Following the environmental crises of the mid-21st century, new philosophies
have emerged around humanity's relationship with the natural world, often
expressed through biological architecture and engineered ecosystems that blend
the technological and natural.
