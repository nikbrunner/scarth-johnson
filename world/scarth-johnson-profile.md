## BACKGROUND

- Born to a Japanese mother (former HX data architecture specialist) and

  leaving Scarth largely independent

- Recruited by HX (then Kang Tao) at age 22 due to exceptional skills and rare
  neural architecture
- Rose quickly through ranks to become part of elite security team
- Betrayed by management who used her as scapegoat for a major security breach
  at age 26
- Corporate reputation deliberately damaged through false information
- Has been freelancing for approximately one year, taking mid-tier jobs below
  her actual capability

- This architecture makes her particularly valuable to Project Ascension and
  consciousness transfer technology
- Her brain structure enables faster processing and integration of information
  than standard neural patterns
- This gives her advantages in infiltration and tactical assessment but also
  makes her a target
