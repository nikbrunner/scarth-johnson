## CONTINUITY CORRECTIONS

### Pixel Storyline Correction

In the current draft, there's an inconsistency regarding Pixel:

- Chapter 1 correctly establishes that Scarth takes Pixel with her to Zoe's safe room when fleeing her apartment
- Chapter 2 incorrectly introduces a "rescue Pixel" subplot where the cat is somehow still at Scarth's apartment

**Solution:**

- Remove the "rescue Pixel" subplot from Chapter 2
- Instead, have Zoe contact Scarth about increased Militech activity, warning Scarth they're searching for additional data storage devices
- Maintain that Pixel remains with Scarth throughout her movements (from Zoe's to Vik's to Dex's)
- Use Pixel as a grounding element for Scarth amid the technological complexity and danger

### Other Timeline Adjustments

- Ensure consistent treatment of the prototype Militech deck throughout
- Maintain clear progression of Scarth's understanding of consciousness transfer technology
- Keep consistent characterization of all supporting characters
- Ensure logical travel times between locations in Night City
