## CHAPTER 3: STEP UP

"It's like riding a bike," Zoe tells me. "You never really forget."

We're sitting in The Fractured Glass before opening hours, reviewing corporate social protocols on a secured tablet. Marcus Wen provided a comprehensive dossier on the Cygnus Solutions event—guest list, venue layout, security measures, and expected social dynamics. It's been five years since I navigated a high-society corporate function. The muscle memory feels rusty.

"Except if you fall off this bike, the consequences are significantly worse than scraped knees," I mutter, swiping through profiles of key Cygnus executives I might encounter.

Zoe smiles, the bioluminescent modifications on her arm pulsing with amusement. "I've seen you talk your way past HX security with a fabricated identity and corrupted credentials. Corporate small talk should be manageable by comparison."

"Different skill set. Security guards follow predictable protocols. Corporate socialites are chaos variables."

"True." She takes the tablet, scrolling to a section on the event itself. "But you have advantages. The event is showcasing NeuroSync technology to potential investors and partners. Every person there will be focused on making connections, gathering intelligence, and positioning themselves. No one will be paying close attention to another well-dressed woman circulating through the crowd."

She's right, but that doesn't settle the unease in my stomach. I've deliberately avoided corporate spaces since my exit from HX. The thought of willingly stepping back into that world, even under a false identity, makes my pulse quicken in ways that armed security never does.

"Your cover identity is solid," Zoe continues, sensing my hesitation. "Mira Chen, technology correspondent for Pacific Rim Business Journal. Credentials are being fabricated now, and you already have the necessary background to discuss tech intelligently."

"And if I run into someone who knows the real Mira Chen?"

"The real Mira Chen is currently on assignment in Australia and hasn't been to N'Kyoto in three years. The odds of encountering someone with a personal connection to her are minimal." Zoe looks up from the tablet. "Marcus doesn't leave details to chance."

No, he doesn't. In the two days since I accepted the job, I've been impressed by the thoroughness of his preparation. Every contingency addressed, every resource provided, no expense spared. It's a level of professionalism I haven't experienced since leaving corporate service.

"The key is to blend in while gathering the necessary intel to access the server room," Zoe says. "You don't need to be the most memorable person there—just unmemorable enough that no one questions your presence."

"Unmemorable isn't typically my problem," I say dryly.

She laughs. "Fair point. You'll need to calibrate your natural... presence... to be noticed enough to seem legitimate without attracting undue attention."

My "natural presence," as Zoe delicately puts it, has always been a double-edged sword. People notice me, regardless of my intentions. In some situations, it's useful distraction. In others, a liability. For this job, I'll need to walk a careful line.

"Have you decided what you're wearing?" Zoe asks.

"Lin's dress. Marcus approved it—apparently she's outfitted other operatives for him before."

"That doesn't surprise me. Lin's always known more than she lets on." Zoe closes the tablet. "The dress is just one component. You'll need the complete package—hair, makeup, accessories, demeanor."

"I remember how to play corporate."

"Of course you do." She stands, gathering her things. "But you need one more resource before you're ready, and he's famously difficult to pin down."

I already know who she means. "Dex."

"You'll need cutting-edge tech for this level of job. No one has better access to proprietary prototypes than Alexander Bluehand."

She's right, though I've been avoiding that particular conclusion. Dex and I have history—complicated, intense, and ultimately painful history. But his access to bleeding-edge technology is unmatched outside corporate R&D labs.

"I know where to find him," I say, rising from the table.

"Be careful, Scarth." Zoe's expression turns serious. "Dex is brilliant, but his loyalty is always to the highest bidder."

"I learned that lesson the hard way."

She nods, understanding passing between us. My relationship with Dex ended when I discovered he was selling information about HX security systems—information I had unknowingly provided. It was never proven that he contributed to my downfall at the company, but the timing was suspiciously convenient.

"Marcus left something for you," Zoe says, producing a small case from beneath the bar. "New comms equipment and an advance for expenses."

I take the case, surprised by its weight. Inside is a state-of-the-art communications module that must have cost more than my last three jobs combined, along with a credstick loaded with enough currency to cover significant "expenses."

"He doesn't mess around," I murmur.

"No, he doesn't." Zoe places a hand on my arm. "This job is your audition, Scarth. Succeed, and doors open that you didn't even know existed."

"And if I fail?"

Her bioluminescent patterns pulse once, darkly. "Then you're back to Meridian-level jobs. If you're lucky."

---

Dex's workshop occupies the top floor of a repurposed industrial building in what used to be the manufacturing district before production moved to automated facilities outside the city. The exterior is deliberately dilapidated—crumbling concrete, graffiti-covered walls, broken windows patched with synthetic polymer sheets. It screams "abandoned" to anyone passing by.

I know better. The building contains some of the most advanced security technology in N'Kyoto, camouflaged by strategic decay. Finding the actual entrance requires knowledge that isn't available to casual visitors.

I approach from the east side, identifying the specific pattern of broken windows that indicates the current access point. This month, it's a maintenance door hidden behind a dumpster overflowing with convincingly realistic trash. The door itself appears rusted shut, but a careful application of pressure at specific points triggers the concealed scanner to read my biometric signature.

There's a soft click, and the door opens inward to reveal a pristine white corridor—a stark contrast to the building's exterior. I step inside, the door sealing behind me as decontamination mist descends from ceiling vents, removing any external particulates from my clothing and skin.

"Identify," comes a computerized voice.

"Scarth Johnson."

"Verification required."

I suppress a sigh. "The Kyoto cherry blossoms only fall once."

It's a passphrase Dex implemented years ago, a private joke from our brief time together. The fact that he hasn't changed it speaks to either sentimentality or laziness. Knowing Dex, probably the latter.

The corridor lights shift from white to blue, indicating acceptance, and a panel slides open at the far end. I follow the illuminated path through a series of security checkpoints—each more sophisticated than the last—until I reach the central workspace.

Dex's sanctum is a technological wonderland. Curved display panels form a 270-degree arc around a modified acceleration chair, currently occupied by his lean form. Holographic projections float in the air, showing what appears to be a security system schematic. Multiple workbenches line the walls, each dedicated to different projects in various stages of completion.

"Well, well," comes his voice before he turns. "The prodigal operator returns."

Alexander "Dex" Bluehand swivels to face me, his custom optical implant glowing electric blue against his pale face. He's thinner than when I last saw him, his shock of blue hair longer and more chaotic, but the sharp intelligence in his remaining natural eye is unchanged.

"Hello, Dex."

He grins, the expression transforming his face from austere to boyish in an instant. "It must be something significant to bring you to my humble workshop. Last time I pinged you, I received a rather creative suggestion about where to store my interface cables."

"I was working."

"You're always working." He rises from the chair in a fluid motion, the bioluminescent circuit patterns along his arms pulsing as he stretches. "Yet here you are, which means you need something only I can provide."

I hate how easily he reads me, even after all this time. "I have a job that requires specialized equipment."

"Corporate level?"

I hesitate, but there's no point in hiding it. Dex has information sources throughout N'Kyoto. "Cygnus Solutions."

His eyebrows rise, the blue optical implant brightening with interest. "Moving up in the world, Scarth? That's several tiers above your usual operations."

"Are you going to help or not?"

"Of course I'll help," he says, circling me like a predator assessing prey. "But I'm curious—who's backing this venture? You don't have the resources to prepare for Cygnus-level security on your own."

"That's not your concern."

"Marcus Wen," he says confidently. "It has to be. No one else would take the risk on an operator who's been strictly mid-tier for the past year."

I keep my expression neutral, but he catches the minute reaction anyway. His grin widens.

"Good for you. Wen only works with the best." He stops circling, standing close enough that I can smell the faint electrical scent that always accompanies him—ozone and synthetic sandalwood. "What specifically do you need?"

"Access technology for Cygnus security systems. Data extraction capabilities for isolated servers. Emergency countermeasures."

He walks to a workbench, gesturing for me to follow. "Cygnus uses Quantum-7 protocols for their main security grid. Bleeding edge, but not impenetrable." He retrieves a small device from a secure drawer. "This neural bridge bypass will connect directly with their security panels, spoofing authorized biometric patterns."

I examine the device—smaller than the one I used at Meridian, with more sophisticated architecture. "Will it work on executive-level restrictions?"

"Up to and including C-suite," he confirms. "They updated their security last month, but the core vulnerability remains. Their system checks for pattern matches without verifying the transmission source."

He moves to another workbench and unlocks a cabinet filled with data extraction equipment. "For the server, you'll need this." He selects a specialized spike, barely larger than my thumb. "It will copy encrypted data without triggering the integrity monitoring systems. Quantum-level encryption breaking would take months, but I assume your client has those resources."

"And emergency countermeasures?"

Dex's expression turns serious. "Cygnus security response is no joke, Scarth. If you're identified, they deploy Enforcer units within 45 seconds. You won't outrun or outfight them." He produces a small silver disc. "Emergency teleport. One-time use, pre-programmed safe extraction point. Use it only as an absolute last resort—the genetic disruption takes days to recover from."

I take the disc, noting its weight. Teleportation technology exists but is prohibitively expensive and medically risky. The fact that Dex has access to it raises questions I probably don't want answered.

"How much?" I ask, reaching for the credstick Marcus provided.

Dex waves it away. "Consider it an investment in our renewed professional relationship."

I narrow my eyes. "What do you want in return?"

"Dinner," he says simply. "After your job is complete. Just the two of us, catching up on old times."

It's never simple with Dex. Dinner means information exchange. It also means navigating the complicated attraction that still simmers between us despite everything that happened.

"Fine. Dinner."

His smile is triumphant as he gathers the equipment into a specialized case. "I've missed working with you, Scarth. Few people appreciate the artistry of what I do."

"I've always appreciated your work," I reply carefully. "It was your other activities I took issue with."

The blue glow of his optical implant dims slightly. "Ancient history. I've evolved since then."

"Have you?"

"We all change." He hands me the case, his fingers brushing mine deliberately. "Some adapt to survive. Others transform to thrive. You were always in the latter category—even if you haven't realized it yet."

The touch sends an unwelcome current through me, memories of our time together surfacing despite my best efforts to suppress them. Whatever his betrayals, Dex and I had a connection that went beyond the physical—a shared understanding of living between worlds, belonging fully to neither.

"Thanks for the equipment," I say, stepping back to break the contact.

"One more thing." He reaches into his pocket and produces a small silver earpiece. "Latest gen subdermal communications link. Undetectable by standard scanners, connects directly to the auditory nerve. Just in case you need... consultation... during the operation."

I take it, recognizing the offer for what it is—a way back into my professional circle. "I work alone, Dex."

"Everyone needs backup sometimes." His voice softens. "Even you, Scarth."

I leave without responding, the case secure under my arm and the earpiece a weighted presence in my pocket. Dex always complicates things, mixing business with the personal in ways that blur boundaries. But he's right about one thing—this job requires resources beyond my usual scope. Having access to his expertise could make the difference between success and failure.

Whether I can trust him is another question entirely.

---

The transformation begins three hours before the Cygnus event.

Lin Chen's navy dress with gold accents fits perfectly, the reactive silk adapting to my body's contours while the micro-armor mesh provides reassuring structure. My hair has been professionally colored and styled, the pink-ash refreshed to a more sophisticated rose-gold that complements the dress. Subtle makeup enhances my features without drawing undue attention, and the gold accents strategically echo the circuitry patterns of my optical enhancements.

The woman in the mirror looks like someone I used to know—a corporate version of myself that I'd deliberately left behind. The posture is different, straighter and more formal. The expression is coolly confident rather than vigilant. Even the way the light catches my modified eyes seems altered, more sophisticated than dangerous.

I secure Dex's equipment beneath the dress, the special compression pocket Lin designed holding everything without disrupting the garment's lines. The neural bridge bypass rests against my left thigh, the data spike against my right, and the emergency teleport disc is concealed within a seemingly decorative gold bracelet. Additionally, I'm wearing three small defensive countermeasures disguised as jewelry—each capable of creating diversions if needed.

The final touch is Dex's communications earpiece, which I reluctantly insert. It melds with my inner ear, connecting seamlessly to my auditory nerve. A soft chime indicates connection to the secure network Marcus established for the operation.

"Testing comms," comes his voice, startlingly clear as if he's standing beside me.

"Receiving," I confirm.

"Excellent. Your transportation will arrive in fifteen minutes. The driver has been briefed on security protocols and entry procedures."

"Understood."

I run through final equipment checks as I wait, ensuring everything is positioned for quick access if needed. The credentials Marcus provided for Mira Chen are impeccable—genuine press pass, digital portfolio of previous articles, even social media history establishing her as a legitimate technology correspondent.

The car that arrives is appropriately understated—a luxury model without being ostentatious, bearing corporate service markings that will allow it to access the restricted drop-off area at the Cygnus Tower. The driver is professional and silent, navigating N'Kyoto's evening traffic with practiced ease.

"Status update," Marcus's voice comes through the earpiece as we approach the corporate district.

"En route. ETA eight minutes."

"Be advised: security has been enhanced since our initial briefing. Additional biometric scanning at the main entrance. Mira Chen's profile has been updated in their system, but minimize direct scanner exposure if possible."

"Acknowledged."

The Cygnus Tower rises before us, its twisting form illuminated from within by a soft blue glow. Unlike the utilitarian Meridian BioTech building, Cygnus embraces artistic design—the structure appears to spiral upward like a strand of DNA, each level slightly offset from the one below. The exterior is a blend of traditional glass and living architectural elements, with bioluminescent patterns flowing across its surface in hypnotic sequences.

"Approaching primary entrance," I report as the car turns into the restricted access lane.

"Remember your objective," Marcus says. "The primary goal is data extraction from the isolated server. All social engagement is in service of that goal."

"Understood."

The car comes to a smooth stop at the designated arrival point. A Cygnus attendant—distinguishable by the subtle blue circuit patterns embroidered on his formal attire—opens the door. I emerge with practiced grace, adopting the confident posture of someone who belongs in these elegant surroundings.

"Welcome to Cygnus Solutions," the attendant says. "May I see your invitation, please?"

I produce the digital credential, allowing him to scan it with his wrist-mounted device. The screen flashes green, confirming my identity as Mira Chen, Pacific Rim Business Journal.

"Thank you, Ms. Chen. Please proceed to the main reception area. The showcase begins in thirty minutes."

I follow the illuminated path toward the grand entrance, my eyes cataloging security measures beneath the guise of journalistic observation. Armed guards positioned discreetly at strategic points. Concealed scanner arrays in the decorative columns. Aerial surveillance drones disguised as architectural elements.

The reception area is a vast atrium dominated by a spiraling sculpture of light that seems to flow like water despite having no physical form. Guests mill about in expensive attire, corporate badges and affiliations subtly indicated through color schemes and emblems. Wait staff circulate with drinks and delicate bioengineered hors d'oeuvres that glow with gentle bioluminescence.

I accept a flute of champagne from a passing server, using the moment to scan the room for key personnel identified in the briefing materials. Several Cygnus executives are already present, engaged in animated conversation with potential investors. A small group of approved media representatives congregates near a holographic display showing the Cygnus logo transforming into abstract patterns.

"I'm in," I murmur, the subvocalization picked up by the earpiece's sensitive receptors.

"Good," Marcus replies. "The server room is located on the mezzanine level, northeast quadrant. Access will be restricted until after the main presentation. Use this time to establish your presence and identify potential access routes."

I circulate through the gathering, adopting the observant but slightly detached demeanor of a technology journalist. I exchange pleasantries with other members of the press, drop appropriate industry terminology into conversation, and gradually work my way toward the mezzanine access points.

"Scarth," Marcus's voice comes through the earpiece with unusual urgency. "Be advised—Diana Weiss just entered the east entrance."

My heart rate spikes, but I maintain my external composure. Diana Weiss was my direct superior at HX, the one who orchestrated my firing and subsequent blacklisting. If anyone would recognize me despite the changed appearance, it would be her.

"Understood," I reply, shifting my position to maintain visual awareness of the east entrance while avoiding direct line of sight.

Diana appears at the top of the stairs, as elegantly imposing as I remember. Her silver-streaked dark hair is pulled into a severe bun, her sharp features accentuated by subtle cosmetic enhancements. She wears a tailored suit in slate gray, the only adornment a pin bearing the combined logos of HX and Cygnus—suggesting a partnership I wasn't aware existed.

"Weiss is now consulting for Cygnus on their neural mapping technologies," Marcus explains, obviously noting my interest in the pin. "Her presence is unexpected but not surprising given the nature of the NeuroSync announcement."

I move deeper into the crowd, using taller guests as visual barriers. Diana hasn't seen me yet, but it's only a matter of time in the enclosed space. I need to adjust my approach.

A soft chime indicates the imminent start of the presentation, and guests begin moving toward the main showcase hall. I use the movement to further distance myself from Diana's position, following the flow toward the massive doors at the far end of the atrium.

The showcase hall is even more impressive than the reception area—a circular space with tiered seating surrounding a central stage. The ceiling is a dome of reactive glass that currently displays a night sky filled with constellations that subtly form the Cygnus logo when viewed from certain angles.

I find a seat on the upper tier where I can observe both the presentation and the room exits. Diana Weiss takes a position near the front, close to the Cygnus executives—confirmation of her significant role in whatever is being unveiled tonight.

"The server room will be minimally staffed during the presentation," Marcus informs me. "Security personnel are focused on the showcase hall."

"Acknowledged, but Weiss complicates extraction timing."

"Adapt as necessary. The data is the priority."

The lights dim, and a tall Japanese man in an impeccably tailored blue suit takes the stage. Haruki Tanaka, Chief of Security for Cygnus Solutions' N'Kyoto division, according to the briefing materials. His physical presence is immediately commanding—athletic build, perfect posture, subtle but high-end enhancements evident in the precision of his movements.

"Distinguished guests," Tanaka begins, his voice rich and confident, "thank you for joining us on this momentous evening. For two decades, Cygnus Solutions has pushed the boundaries of what is possible at the intersection of human consciousness and technology. Tonight, we take the next evolutionary step."

The dome above transforming into a massive display showing neural connection patterns that pulse and flow with lifelike rhythm.

"NeuroSync technology represents a paradigm shift in how we understand the relationship between individual consciousness and shared experience," Tanaka continues. "For the first time, we can create direct connection between minds—not merely communication, but true shared consciousness."

Murmurs ripple through the audience as the implications sink in. Shared consciousness has been theorized but never successfully implemented outside experimental environments with significant limitations. If Cygnus has achieved a workable solution, it represents a staggering advancement.

The presentation continues with technical explanations and carefully staged demonstrations using volunteer Cygnus employees. The technology appears to allow limited sharing of sensory experiences and emotional states between connected individuals—impressive, but clearly still in early development stages.

Throughout the presentation, I'm evaluating escape routes and security positions while maintaining the appearance of a journalist taking mental notes. Diana Weiss remains focused on the stage, but I catch her scanning the audience periodically—a habit from her security background at HX.

As the presentation reaches its midpoint, I recognize my opportunity. Security attention is fully directed toward the demonstration, and the server room will be at its most vulnerable.

"Moving to secondary objective," I murmur, rising from my seat and slipping toward the exit with the deliberate purpose of someone seeking a restroom.

"Acknowledged," Marcus responds. "Proceed with caution."

I navigate through the curved corridors of the mezzanine level, my internal map guiding me toward the northeast quadrant. My demeanor shifts subtly as I walk—still professional but now purposeful, as if on official business. It's a delicate balance between looking like I belong and not drawing attention.

The server room is accessible through a staff corridor marked with subtle Cygnus signage. I approach confidently, already preparing the neural bridge bypass concealed beneath my dress. The security panel beside the door requires both biometric confirmation and authorization codes—exactly as outlined in the briefing materials.

I place my palm against the scanner, the neural bridge beneath my skin activating and feeding the system the expected patterns of an authorized executive. The panel flashes green, and the door slides open with a soft pneumatic hiss.

Inside, the server room is bathed in blue light from the rack-mounted systems that line the walls. The isolated server containing the NeuroSync data is immediately identifiable by its standalone configuration and enhanced security measures. As expected, the room is empty—all technical staff assigned to support the ongoing presentation.

I move quickly to the isolated system, retrieving the specialized data spike from its concealed pocket. The interface port is protected by an additional layer of security, but the spike's advanced protocols make short work of the defenses. Connection established, data transfer beginning.

"In position, beginning extraction," I subvocalize.

"Understood," Marcus replies. "Be advised, presentation entering final phase. Expedite if possible."

The data transfer proceeds more slowly than I'd like—the isolated system's architecture is more complex than the briefing indicated. I watch the progress indicator with growing tension, aware that each passing second increases the risk of discovery.

Footsteps in the corridor outside. I freeze, listening intently. The steps pause at the door, followed by the soft beep of the security panel being activated.

No time to disconnect the spike or find concealment. I adopt the posture and expression of someone performing authorized work, positioning my body to partially conceal the data connection.

The door slides open to reveal Haruki Tanaka, his expression shifting from purpose to surprise upon seeing me.

"This is a restricted area," he says, his voice controlled but sharp with suspicion.

I straighten, offering an apologetic smile. "I'm so sorry. Mira Chen, Pacific Rim Business Journal." I gesture to my credentials. "I was told this was the press resource room for accessing technical specifications after the presentation."

His eyes narrow slightly, assessing me with the practiced evaluation of a security professional. "The press room is in the southwest quadrant. This area is clearly marked as restricted."

"The directions I received must have been incorrect." I retrieve the data spike with a subtle movement, the transfer only partially complete. "I'll find my way to the correct location. My apologies for the intrusion."

I move toward the door, maintaining the embarrassed but professional demeanor of a journalist who has made an honest mistake. Tanaka doesn't step aside.

"Security protocols require verification of all unauthorized access to restricted areas," he says, his voice softening slightly despite the words. "I'll need to escort you to security for confirmation of your credentials."

A direct security check would immediately expose my false identity. I need an alternative approach, quickly.

I allow my posture to shift subtly, my expression changing from professional detachment to more personal engagement. "Of course, I understand completely." I meet his eyes directly, noting his involuntary reaction to the increased attention. "Security is your responsibility, after all. I wouldn't want to compromise that."

The slight dilation of his pupils and fractional change in his breathing confirm what the briefing materials suggested—Haruki Tanaka responds to attractive women, despite his professional discipline. It's a vulnerability I can use, though I dislike the necessity.

"Perhaps you could escort me personally?" I suggest, my tone conveying both respect for his position and subtle interest. "I'd appreciate the opportunity to learn more about Cygnus's approach to integrated security systems for an upcoming article."

His expression changes almost imperceptibly—professional suspicion tempered by personal interest. "That would be irregular."

"As irregular as finding me here, I suppose," I acknowledge with a self-deprecating smile. "But potentially more productive for both of us."

A moment of decision passes across his face before he nods once. "I'll accompany you to the press area. We can discuss your... article... there."

"Thank you, Mr. Tanaka." I step past him, careful to maintain appropriate professional distance while still conveying subtle signals of mutual interest.

He escorts me through the corridors, our conversation shifting between security protocols and more personal topics as I carefully balance professional journalist persona with hints of genuine connection. By the time we reach the actual press room, Tanaka's suspicion has been replaced by interest—not enough to completely lower his guard, but sufficient to override his initial security concerns.

"Perhaps we could continue this discussion after the event," he suggests as we reach the press area. "There are aspects of integrated security that aren't covered in the public materials."

"I'd like that," I reply, maintaining the delicate balance between professional interest and personal connection.

He produces a small card embossed with the Cygnus logo and his contact information. "My direct line. For your article."

I accept it with precisely calibrated gratitude. "Thank you for your assistance, Mr. Tanaka. And for not having me detained for my navigational error."

A small smile touches his lips. "Everyone makes mistakes, Ms. Chen. The important thing is how we recover from them."

As he departs, I subvocalize to Marcus, "Partial data acquired. Security complication resolved, but extraction window is closing."

"Understood," he replies. "Complete extraction not possible without additional risk. Proceed to extraction point with current data."

I spend twenty minutes in the press room, maintaining my cover identity while preparing for departure. Diana Weiss never enters the area, a small mercy in an increasingly complicated operation. When sufficient time has passed to make my exit natural, I gather my things and move toward the main atrium with the other departing guests.

The extraction proceeds smoothly—no additional security checks, no unexpected encounters. The same corporate car collects me from the designated pickup area, and I'm safely away from Cygnus Tower within minutes.

"Package secured," I report once we're clear of the corporate district. "Approximately 60% of target data based on transfer metrics."

"Well done," Marcus responds, satisfaction evident in his voice. "Return to the safe house for debrief and data transfer."

As the car navigates through N'Kyoto's evening traffic, I find myself thinking about Haruki Tanaka. There was something unexpected in our interaction—a genuine quality to his interest that transcended the typical security officer/potential threat dynamic. In another context, under different circumstances, I might have been genuinely interested in continuing our conversation.

An uncomfortable realization, considering I was actively stealing from his company while laying the groundwork for potential future exploitation of his interest.

This job is already blurring lines I've kept firmly drawn since leaving HX. The corporate world, with its complex social dynamics and multi-layered deceptions, was something I'd deliberately left behind. Now I'm not only re-entering that world but doing so with greater awareness of its mechanisms and vulnerabilities.

The question remains whether I'm controlling those mechanisms or being controlled by them.

Either way, there's no going back now. I've taken the step up that Marcus Wen offered. Where it leads remains to be seen.
