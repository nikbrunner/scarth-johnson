# CHAPTER 1: BUSINESS AS USUAL

I hate corporate architecture.

All these sleek lines and organic curves designed to make you feel insignificant. The Meridian BioTech building looms above me, its façade a blend of glass and bioengineered panels that pulse with subtle bioluminescence in the night. Forty-eight stories of proprietary research, predatory business practices, and security systems designed to keep people like me out.

Tonight, those systems will fail. Not because they're flawed, but because I'm better.

"Approaching entry point," I subvocalize, the words carried through the encrypted channel to my handler for this job.

"Copy that, Scarth," comes the reply. "Security rotation in sixty seconds. Remember, we need those patent files intact."

I resist the urge to roll my eyes. Finch always states the obvious, but he pays on time and doesn't ask questions about my methods. In this business, that counts for something.

The soft rain is cool against my skin as I crouch in the maintenance alley. My black tactical bodysuit – a custom piece from HX's elite security division that cost me three months of jobs to acquire after I was fired – reacts to the moisture, tightening slightly to maintain optimal temperature. Small compensations for waiting in the rain.

Security drones make their programmed pass overhead, their sensors sweeping the area in predictable patterns. Predictable means exploitable. I count down silently, watching the timer in my optical display. Three... two... one...

I move precisely as the blind spot opens, slipping through the maintenance entrance using credentials I spent two weeks extracting from a mid-level Meridian engineer over drinks and between sheets. He was handsome enough to make the job pleasant, forgettable enough that I don't feel bad using what I learned. Business is business.

The service corridor is dimly lit with emergency strips, their soft blue glow providing just enough light for unmodified maintenance workers. My enhanced vision renders the space in perfect clarity, highlighting the security camera mounted near the ceiling. Its red activation light blinks steadily, but I know it's seeing nothing but an empty hallway – courtesy of the localized loop I installed during my reconnaissance last week.

"I'm in," I whisper.

"Good. You have eighteen minutes before the security system requires manual verification."

I move efficiently down the corridor, my footsteps silent. My heart rate is elevated but controlled – the familiar pre-job adrenaline that makes everything sharper, more focused. I live for this feeling, this heightened state where every sense is alert and decisions come with crystal clarity.

The first guard station is exactly where the building schematics indicated. One guard, male, early thirties, with standard corporate enhancement package – nothing special. He's not expecting trouble; this deep in the building, most threats have been filtered out by the external security systems.

I could avoid him entirely. The ventilation system would allow me to bypass this checkpoint. But that route would take longer, and time is my enemy tonight. Besides, I've found that sometimes the direct approach is least expected.

I adjust my posture subtly, accentuating the curves of my figure, and let my hair fall forward in the way that draws attention to my face. Then I round the corner deliberately, my steps now audible.

The guard looks up, startled. His hand moves toward his weapon, but hesitates as he registers my appearance. That split-second of confusion is all I need.

"Excuse me," I say, my voice sliding into a higher, slightly breathless register. "I think I'm lost. I was supposed to meet Dr. Yamamoto on level six, but the elevator took me here instead."

His eyes flick to my face, down to my body, then back up – the predictable assessment I've seen countless times. His posture relaxes slightly. "This is a restricted area, ma'am. I'll need to see your credentials."

I step closer, fumbling in my pocket. "Of course, I have them right here..." The movement brings me within arm's reach. "I'm so sorry to trouble you. It's my first day consulting."

"What department did you say—"

The question dies as I move. My hand snaps up with the tranquilizer patch, slapping it against his neck before he can react. His eyes widen in shock, then glaze as the fast-acting compound enters his bloodstream. I catch his weight as he crumples, easing him silently to the floor.

"Neat," I mutter, dragging him into the small security booth. Unconscious, not dead – I don't kill unless absolutely necessary. It's one of my rules. Not from moral qualms, but practicality. Dead bodies escalate situations in ways that unconscious ones don't.

I access the security terminal with the guard's credentials, temporarily disabling the next section's motion sensors. The real security in this building isn't human anyway – it's the automated systems, the neural scanners, the DNA readers. The guards are just there to handle the situations the automated systems flag.

The elevator requires both biometric authentication and a security code. I use the patch I harvested from my engineer friend's coffee cup for the DNA sample and the code I lifted from his personal files. The doors slide open with a soft chime.

"Checkpoint two cleared," I subvocalize. "Moving to target floor."

"Copy. Be advised, you're two minutes ahead of schedule."

The elevator ascends smoothly to the thirty-second floor – Research and Development. As the doors open, I initiate my next layer of countermeasures. The small device clipped to my belt emits a carefully calibrated electromagnetic signature that mimics an authorized maintenance tech. The security system logs my presence but flags it as routine.

The R&D floor is dark except for the ambient glow from equipment and status lights. Three researchers are working late, but they're concentrated in the west wing, away from my target. I move through the shadows toward the central server room, where the isolated system containing the patent data is stored.

A soft beeping alerts me to movement ahead. Another guard, approaching on his regular patrol route. This one won't be as easy to distract – he's in full tactical gear with enhanced sensory implants, judging by the distinctive glow around his eyes. Military-grade, probably ex-special forces hired for the premium security package. He'll detect me the moment I enter his field of vision.

I press myself into a recessed doorway, weighing my options. I could wait for him to pass, but that would cost precious minutes. I could try to circle around, but the layout of the floor doesn't provide a clear alternative route.

Direct approach it is, then.

I reach for my sidearm – a modified Kongou pistol with a sound suppressor – but stop myself. Gunshots, even suppressed ones, leave evidence that can be traced. Instead, I feel the familiar warmth spreading through my forearms as I activate my HX-11 Dermal Armaments – "Bio Blades" on the street. The genetically engineered bone-carbon hybrid structures stir beneath my skin, blue-tinged capillaries briefly illuminating the pathways along my fingers as the transformation begins.

Within seconds, razor-edged extensions emerge from beneath my nails, my ordinary-looking hands becoming lethal weapons. The living blades – perfectly bonded to my unique genetic profile and neural architecture – remain virtually undetectable by standard security scans even when deployed. A rare and expensive parting gift from HX's exclusive enhancement program before they used me as their scapegoat.

The guard turns the corner, his attention focused on the tablet in his hand – reviewing security protocols, most likely. I launch myself from the doorway in complete silence, covering the distance between us in three rapid strides. His enhanced senses alert him at the last moment – his head snaps up, eyes widening – but it's too late.

My hand clamps over his mouth while my claws pierce the soft spot below his ear, severing the neural connection to his enhancement implants. His body goes rigid, then limp. Not dead, but completely disabled until someone recalibrates his systems. I ease him to the floor, retracting my claws. A thin trickle of blood is the only evidence of the intervention.

"Sorry," I whisper, though he can't hear me. "Job requirements."

The server room door requires executive clearance. For this, I use my most expensive tool – a neural bridge bypass that connects directly to the security panel, feeding it the complex biometric patterns it expects to receive from authorized personnel. The technology is illegal in most jurisdictions, and cost me nearly a year's worth of jobs on the black market. Worth every credit for situations exactly like this.

The panel lights shift from red to green, and the reinforced door slides open with a pneumatic hiss. Inside, rows of servers hum quietly, their status lights blinking in hypnotic patterns. The stand-alone system I need is in the center, physically isolated from the network to prevent remote intrusion.

"I'm at the target," I report. "Beginning extraction."

"Copy. Thirteen minutes remaining."

I connect my specialized data spike to the isolated terminal. The proprietary encryption would take days to crack by brute force, but I'm not here to crack it – just to copy the encrypted data. My client has their own experts to handle that part.

The progress bar advances steadily as the data transfers. My enhanced hearing picks up the soft footsteps of someone approaching – lighter than a guard, probably one of the researchers. I disconnect quickly, the transfer only 70% complete.

Hiding isn't an option in the open server room. I position myself beside the door, ready to subdue whoever enters. The footsteps stop just outside, and I hear the beep of the security panel.

The door slides open to reveal a young woman in a lab coat, her attention focused on the tablet in her hands. She steps inside, still not looking up.

"Maintenance complete," I say confidently, adopting the clipped tones of a corporate technician.

She startles, nearly dropping her tablet. "I didn't know IT was scheduled tonight."

"Emergency patch for the quantum encryption module," I reply, gesturing vaguely toward the servers. "Critical vulnerability identified in the latest security update."

Her eyes narrow slightly. "I should have received notification."

"It was flagged as urgent-immediate. Notification protocols were bypassed to expedite deployment." I step past her casually, moving toward the door. "The system will reboot automatically in approximately three minutes. I wouldn't start any new processing jobs until then."

She's still suspicious, but the technical jargon and my confident demeanor make her hesitate just long enough. I'm through the door before she can formulate a challenge.

"Potential compromise," I subvocalize. "Need an alternate extraction route."

"Use the service elevator in the east wing," Finch responds immediately. "I'm overriding the security protocols now."

I move swiftly through the dark office space, hearing the researcher trigger an alert behind me. Alarms will follow shortly. The job has officially transitioned from stealth to escape.

The service elevator is across the floor, past the area where the other researchers are working. As the first alarm begins to sound, I break into a sprint, abandoning stealth for speed.

A researcher steps into the corridor ahead, drawn by the alarm. His eyes widen as he sees me running toward him. Before he can react, I leap, using his shoulder as a springboard to vault over him entirely. He sprawls forward with a startled cry as I land and continue running without breaking stride.

The service elevator is locked down, its panel flashing red. Finch's override hasn't engaged.

"Elevator's secured," I report, ducking into a side corridor as security personnel flood onto the floor. "Moving to plan C."

Plan C is always the same: find a window and use my specialized descent gear. More dangerous, more visible, but effective when all other options are exhausted.

I locate a window in an empty office, reinforced glass designed to withstand the pressure at this height. My claws make short work of the electronic lock, and the window slides open, letting in a rush of cool night air and rain.

"Exiting via external descent, south face," I inform Finch as I attach my cable launcher to the window frame. The magnetic grapple locks securely in place. I test it with a sharp tug, then step onto the ledge.

The view from thirty-two stories is dizzying – N'Kyoto's skyline spread out below, a sea of lights and movement. The rain has intensified, falling in sheets now. Not ideal conditions for a rapid descent, but I've worked with worse.

"Security drones deploying," Finch warns. "ETA forty seconds."

No time for a controlled descent, then. I take a deep breath, secure the line to my tactical harness, and step backward into empty space.

The controlled fall is exhilarating, the cable paying out at a carefully calibrated rate that's just slow enough to prevent injury but fast enough to cover significant distance quickly. The wind and rain whip against my face as I plummet down the side of the building.

Sixteen stories down, I hear the distinctive whine of security drones approaching. I press the emergency stop on my harness, jerking to a halt beside a darkened window. The abrupt stop sends pain shooting through my shoulders, but the harness distributes the force enough to prevent serious injury.

Three drones sweep past above me, their searchlights cutting through the rain. They're looking for someone descending – not someone stationary against the building face. Once they pass, I release the brake and continue my controlled fall.

Near the tenth floor, a window ahead of me suddenly illuminates, revealing a security team preparing to intercept me. I swing my body sideways, building momentum until I'm swinging in an arc away from the building face. At the apex of my swing, I release the primary cable and fire my secondary grapple at an adjacent building.

The moment of freefall between releases lasts less than two seconds, but feels like an eternity. The secondary line catches, transferring my momentum into a swing toward the other building. I crash through a decorative screen on its exterior, tumbling onto the floor of what appears to be an empty office space.

Rolling to my feet, I disconnect from the line and move quickly through the darkened office toward the emergency stairs.

"Target building infiltrated," I report. "Proceeding to extraction point."

"Security converging on your previous location," Finch confirms. "You have a clear path to extraction. Did you secure the data?"

I check the data spike secured against my thigh. Its status light glows steady green – 70% of the target data, enough to satisfy the client if not earn the full bonus.

"Partial acquisition. Primary objective secured."

Twenty minutes later, I'm three districts away, my tactical suit concealed beneath a nondescript rain jacket, walking calmly through the crowded streets of the entertainment district. The rain has turned to a light drizzle, and the neon signs reflect in puddles at my feet, painting the wet pavement in electric colors.

The adrenaline is fading now, leaving the familiar post-job clarity I've come to appreciate. Another successful extraction, another payment to maintain my independence in a city where everything and everyone is owned by someone.

My apartment building is in the Mid-District – not corporate housing, but not the squalor of the Undercity either. The security is decent, supplemented by my own additions. I take the stairs instead of the elevator, a habit from jobs that's become routine in daily life. Always know your escape routes.

Inside my apartment, I'm greeted by a soft chirp as Pixel jumps down from her perch near the window. The small biomonitor embedded beneath her fur glows briefly as she recognizes me, her enhanced pupils dilating in the dim light.

"Hey, girl," I murmur, kneeling to scratch behind her ears. "Uneventful night?"

She purrs in response, rubbing against my legs. I check her monitor readout – normal vitals, no signs of distress. The security system shows no attempted breaches during my absence.

I peel off the rain jacket and tactical suit, dropping them into the specialized cleaning unit that will remove any trace evidence from the fabric. The dataspike I secure in a shielded compartment built into my bedframe. Payment on delivery, those are the terms.

Standing under the hot shower, I watch as pink-tinged water swirls down the drain – blood from the guard's neck, despite my careful approach. I flex my fingers, feeling the slight ache around the neural connectors where my claws extend. Dr. Takeda would tell me I'm overusing them, that the tissue needs time to recover between deployments. But Takeda doesn't have to pay my rent.

After dressing in loose pants and a tank top, I prepare a cup of matcha tea, the ritual movements calming after the intensity of the job. I settle cross-legged on the floor cushion in front of the small butsudan in the corner of my living space. My father's photo smiles back at me, forever frozen at age forty-two.

"Another day, another job," I tell him softly. "Nothing special, just the usual."

The photo doesn't answer, of course. But the ritual grounds me, reminds me why I do this work. Independence. Security. The freedom to make my own choices after years of corporate control.

My secure comm unit chimes softly from the bedroom – Finch, probably, confirming the extraction point for the data handoff tomorrow. But when I check the message, it's not from any contact I recognize. The sender code is carefully anonymized, bounced through multiple proxy servers.

The message is simple:

_You're better than extraction jobs. Your skills are being wasted. If you're interested in work that matches your potential, come to The Fractured Glass tomorrow. 9 PM. Ask for Marcus._

I stare at the message for a long moment, then delete it. Unsolicited job offers are almost always traps or scams. Besides, I have a system that works. Reliable clients, manageable risks, steady income. Why complicate things?

But as I lie in bed, Pixel curled against my side, I find myself thinking about those words. _Your skills are being wasted._ The truth is, tonight's job was almost too easy. The challenge that once made my pulse race is becoming routine.

Maybe it's time to see what else is out there.

Maybe there's more to Scarth Johnson than even I've realized.

I close my eyes, but sleep is a long time coming.
