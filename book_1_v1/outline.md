# SCARTH JOHNSON SERIES: DIAMOND IN THE ROUGH

## CONCEPT

Scarth Johnson is an exceptional infiltrator and extractor who handles mid-tier
jobs in N'Kyoto with ruthless efficiency. When a seemingly routine corporate
extraction job goes sideways, she crosses paths with a mysterious fixer who
recognizes that her talents are being wasted on standard work. As this mentor
